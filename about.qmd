I've gone by different titles -- sociologist, data analyst, psychometrician, assessment director -- but the common thread of my career has been data. For over 20 years I've applied tools from measurement, statistics, and empirical research design to help leaders of organizations use data to make more informed decisions.

My background is sociology. My undergraduate work at Arizona State (B.A., 1993) was in sociology, as was my early graduate work at Virginia Tech (M.S., 1997). Back then I was interested in the sociology of religion and politics, and I found inspiration and guidance in the work of [Fr. Andrew Greeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Greeley). The topic of my [thesis](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/41008) was the political mobilization of Evangelical Protestants. It was a statistical analysis of data from a national survey.

In 2000, I went to work in public education. I landed a job in the central office of a school district as its first Student Learning Data Analyst, and there I spent six years helping administrators and teachers interpret data from student achievement tests. This was a time of education reform at the federal and state levels which created mounting pressure at the local level to use student achievement data to make educational decisions. In that time I completed a doctorate in educational psychology with a specialization in measurement and cognates in motivation and educational leadership. My [dissertation](https://orbiscascade-washington.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UW/1juclfo/alma99122253190001452) looked at high school teachers' use of student achievement data. This project, too, was a statistical analysis of data from a survey.

Upon completing my doctorate I went to work in administration, where, for ten years, I was Director of Assessment for several school districts. In that role I oversaw administration of high-stakes testing, implemented district tests and data warehouses, analyzed and reported results of all student data, evaluated instructional programs, and did professional development on all aspects of data. On the side I did validity studies of my work in assessment, the results of which I [presented at conferences](talks.qmd) and [published in journals](pubs.qmd). I was active in two professional associations. At the state level, as a board member of the Washington Educational Research Association (WERA) I helped plan conferences, edit newsletters, and award research grants; and at the national level, I served terms as Secretary and President of the National Association of Test Directors (NATD).

Since 2017, I have helped lead data-based decision-making for the Catholic schools in western Washington, the pastoral planning department of the Archdiocese of Seattle, and now the pharmacy departments of the Swedish Medical Center hospitals in my region. For ten years I have been a Research Associate providing psychometric expertise for the Social & Economic Sciences Research Center (SESRC) at Washington State University, and this fall marks my second as an Adjunct Instructor for Gonzaga University co-teaching courses on analysis of quantitative data to doctoral candidates in the Department of Educational Leadership & Administration.

On the side I continue to study data from large surveys. I have created several Tableau workbooks for exploring data on American religious identification, and I am currently studying the validity of data from a recently developed clinical scale of spiritual harm and abuse.
